# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
​
This refactor acted as an opportunity to improve the accessibility of the site via the addition of alternative text to provide image description. All links are now active on page and it has a clear title shown in browser. The semantic code and CSS styles were clarified and given cleaner structure. This was also a chance to add comments for quicker clean-up tasks in the future.
