# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
​
This refactor acted as an opportunity to improve the accessibility of the site via the addition of alternative text to provide image description. All links are now active on page and it has a clear title shown in browser. The semantic code and CSS styles were clarified and given cleaner structure. This was also a chance to add comments for quicker clean-up tasks in the future. 

## User Story
​
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
​
## Acceptance Criteria
​
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
